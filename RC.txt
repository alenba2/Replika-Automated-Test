Hello
What are you doing right now?
Nothing as interesting as that lol. What music are you listening to?
Did you hear what happened at the oscars lmao
Have you seen the new Thor trailer?
So what'd you think of it
What do you think about what's been going on recently
Should I get Chinese or Italian food?
I don't really like spaghetti
I mean I like a good chicken alfredo though!
Tbh the loki show is overrated
The new drink at starbucks is so good. I can see the hype.
falcon and the winter soldier is probably my favorite out of the new marvel shows, and then wandavision by a slim margin
I think rina sawayama is literally a pop icon
I'll tell you about it some other time. Gotta go!
